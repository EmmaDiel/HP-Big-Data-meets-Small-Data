# HP-Big-Data-meets-Small-Data

Here you can find the material used in the workgroup sessions for the Honors program course "Big Data meets Small Data" developed at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The course material can be accessed here: <https://github.com/EmmaDiel/HP-Big-Data-meets-Small-Data.git>

## Preparations

Before our first practical session, ensure you downloaded RStudio on your laptop and familiarised yourself with the setup. These two outlines will help do so:

* [Installing R and RStudio](https://github.com/EmmaDiel/HP-Big-Data-meets-Small-Data/blob/main/Preparation/R-basics---Installing-R.md)

* [R Basics](https://github.com/EmmaDiel/HP-Big-Data-meets-Small-Data/blob/main/Preparation/R-basics---Getting-started.md)


## Week 5 - Getting started

### Topic: Basic Introduction to RStudio
* Handout: 
  + [Introduction to R (1.1)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/EmmaDiel/HP-Big-Data-meets-Small-Data/blob/main/tutorials/-1.1--Introduction-to-R.html)

Please prepare before the session. Some parts should be familiar from the preparations; you can skip those. 

### Topic: Gathering data - Data extraction and data wrangling in RStudio
* Handout: 
  + [R Text Analysis Quanteda (1.2)](https://github.com/EmmaDiel/HP-Big-Data-meets-Small-Data/blob/main/tutorials/-1.2--R-Text-Analysis-Quanteda.md)

We will work through this handout during the practical session. However, feel free to have a look already.

## Week 6 - Computational analysis I 

### Topic: Topic modelling (unsupervised machine learning)
* Handout: 
  + [Exploratory Text Analysis (2.1)](https://github.com/EmmaDiel/HP-Big-Data-meets-Small-Data/blob/main/tutorials/-2.1--Exploratory-Text-Analysis.md)

Please prepare before the session.

### Topic: Sentiment analysis 
* Handout: 
  + [Sentiment Analysis in R (2.2)](https://github.com/EmmaDiel/HP-Big-Data-meets-Small-Data/blob/main/tutorials/-2.2--Sentiment-Analysis.md)
  
We will work through this handout during the practical session. However, feel free to have a look already.

## Week 7 - Computational analysis II 

### Topic: Visualisation of data and findings
* Handout: 
  + [Basics of Data Visualization (3.1)](https://github.com/EmmaDiel/HP-Big-Data-meets-Small-Data/blob/main/tutorials/-3.1--Basics-of-Data-Visualization.md)
